# React company CRUD frontend
HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap 4 and React

A new React CRUD frontend to serve my company data test project. This is part of an ongoing project to improve my skills. I am building a simple company data interface for a fictional company. The interface allows the user to read, add, update, and delete staff and office records.

The frontend is hosted on Google Firebase, talking to a Node/Express/Mongoose backend hosted on Heroku. The backend in turn interacts with a MongoDB database hosted on MongoDB Atlas.

This project is very much a work in progress - so some buttons do not currently work. Current emphasis is on the option to create a new office record and refresh the view on success.
